This file is used for default measurements to refer back to when changing data values. (If the graph file does not specify 
all of the measurements for that particular graph, then the values for the unspecified measurements are default as shown below)

Threshold - 5 or 10
Offset - 50 

Dependent on Graph -
Edge Creation Chance - 40% (.4)
Nodes - 100
Timesteps (usually 2000 for testing accuracy)
Anomalies (19 if 2000 Timesteps) on multiples of 100

AB Graphs -
alpha - .4
Timesteps, Nodes, and Anomaly Induction same as above
m_values - This varies depending on the anomaly difficulty, 
more drastic m values between each change will make the difficulty easier.
Can hold to 100 maximum.
